# Stitch Example - Todo App

This sample app is intended to be used by following the 
[Todo tutorial](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/tutorials/todo-overview/) in the 
Stitch docs. It demonstrates the process of building a React Web app that 
connects to the Stitch backend and uses Atlas for data storage. 

We also have [iOS](https://github.com/mongodb-university/stitch-tutorial-todo-ios),
[Android](https://github.com/mongodb-university/stitch-tutorial-todo-android) and
[GraphQL](https://github.com/mongodb-university/stitch-tutorial-todo-graphql)
versions.
